# Learning to code Neural Networks in Python

Trying to figure out how to code a deep neural network. First see the "nn_example", "nn_classifier" is a more advanced take with NumPy that is more appropriate to look at after the simpler "nn_example" which uses loops. "nn_classifier" is a neural net that tries to classify data as one or the other. You can change some stuff to make it more like nn_example net, though. nn_classifier is deep, you can choose how many layers deep you want it to be.

I'm using 4-spaced tab indentation.

I found reading the code and fiddling to be the best way to understand neural networks. nn_example is actually derived from another source from the web with additions of my fiddling with it. nn_classifier is sort of a rewrite.

Currently `nn_classifier.py` uses MNIST dataset as an example. Simply unpack it from `mnist.tar.gz` and you're done. Mind that each epoch takes quite some time, unfortunately. But you'll be able to see that it works for sure.
