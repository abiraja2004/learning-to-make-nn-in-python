# learning-to-make-nn-in-python

Trying to figure out how to code a deep neural network. First see the "nn_example", "nn_classifier" is a more advanced take with NumPy that is more appropriate to look at after the simpler "nn_example" which uses loops. "nn_classifier" is a neural net that tries to classify data as one or the other. You can change some stuff to make it more like nn_example net, though. nn_classifier is deep, you can choose how many layers deep you want it to be.
